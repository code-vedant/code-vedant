# üí´ About Me:
I‚Äôm Vedant Uekey, a second-year Computer Science Engineering student and a passionate full-stack web developer specializing in the MERN stack. I enjoy building interactive, scalable, and user-focused web applications ‚Äî especially ones that combine technology with creativity and education.

From designing engaging educational games and AI tools to developing feature-rich platforms like a car marketplace with test drive booking, my projects reflect both technical depth and real-world problem-solving. I‚Äôve worked with modern tools like Next.js, Socket IO, Prisma, Supabase, Clerk, Shadcn UI, Daisy UI and I love integrating smart features such as QR code systems, drag-and-drop UIs, and AI-driven logic.

Beyond coding, I have a strong eye for design, with experience in 3D art, poster design, and UI aesthetics, making me just as comfortable with Blender and Canva as I am with VS Code.

I'm currently exploring AI integration, serverless architecture, and building intelligent systems ‚Äî all while maintaining a sharp focus on user experience, performance, and functionality.
